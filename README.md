##Overview
[UBC Simulator](https://slacknotes.com/ubcsimulator) / go Wise Choices is a Choose Your Own Adventure Game whose goal is to get through a year at my university (UBC) with at least a 3.0 GPA and friends at the end of it.

##Motivation
Side project to avoid studying for my CPSC 304 midterm.


##Installation
1. git clone https://github.com/biancasubion/goWiseChoices.git
2. npm install
3. go run main.go

##How It Works
UBC Simulator is a pretty simple game that uses a set of decision trees that it will randomly select a prompt. Once a choice is made, it begins to walk down that path and prunes the path not taken.

##Built With
* [Go](https://golang.org/) - Server
* [React] (https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Front End
* [Pixel Art Maker] (http://pixelartmaker.com/) - To make the background
* [Toggl] (https://toggl.com/startup-simulator/) - For inspiration and to get the artwork/characters
